# 1. Identify the Data Type
# Guess the datatype of the following. Then use type() to confirm.
a = 100
b = 12.5
c = "Python"
d = True
e = [1, 2, 3]
f = (4, 5, 6)
g = {7, 8, 9}
h = {"name": "Kalpna", "age": 22}
print

# 2. Type Conversion Practice
# Convert the following:
# An integer 10 to float
# A float 9.8 to integer
# A string "25" to integer
# A number 44 to string
# Write code to do all the above conversions and print the result with type.
# 3. Detect Type Error
# What will happen here? Try and observe:
# pythonCopyEdita = "10"b = 5 print(a + b)
# Fix the code so that it adds the values numerically.
# 4. Real-World Scenario
# You are storing the following details about a person:
# Name (e.g., "Alex")
# Age (e.g., 30)
# Married or not (e.g., True)
# Hobbies (e.g., ["reading", "cycling"])
# Location as latitude & longitude (e.g., (26.14, 91.76))
# Create variables with proper datatypes to represent this data.
# 5. Mix and Match
# Guess the result and its datatype:
# pythonCopyEditx = 5 + 3.0y = "7" * 3z = 10 > 5
# Use type() to confirm your guesses.
